#summary Performance notes

Don't forget the [http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?RulesOfOptimization rules of optimization] :)

These optimizations were all driven by profiler runs.

= Current Performance =
These values are current for r196, using '`trunk/prototype01/run_simulator.py`'

They were calculated with a 10%-busy-cpu 550Mhz Pentium III.

 * Input file: sanitized LANL-CM5-1994-3.1-cln.swf.gz
 * No. of job submissions: 110769
 * Run time: 26:09.67 minutes (1507 seconds)
 * Jobs per second: 70

= Optimizations Done =
 * parsing input fields lazily in `workload_parser.py`, only a few fields from the SWF format are used
 * removing an assert in `EventQueue.add_event` (verified the event hasn't been entered before), it took almost %80 of the run time

= TODO =
It would be nice to keep slow asserts during development, and remove them only on "production" runs, e.g. with 'python -O' ([http://docs.python.org/ref/assert.html disables assertions]).
